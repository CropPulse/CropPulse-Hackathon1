# GCP-Based Pipeline for AI-Driven Crop Drought Stress Detection

## Introduction and Problem Overview

Building an early-warning tool for crop drought stress requires integrating multi-source geospatial data and machine learning on a scalable platform. We focus on North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) in Germany (approx. 34,000 km², bounding box ~5.8–9.4°E, 50.3–52.5°N) over the past 4–10 years. Key datasets include high-resolution optical satellite imagery, climate data, and soil information:  **Sentinel-2**  (10 m multispectral imagery),  **Landsat 8/9**  (30 m optical + thermal),  **CHIRPS**  rainfall (~0.05° ≈ 5 km grids),  **SoilGrids**  soil properties (250 m), and optionally high-resolution  **drone imagery**for local validation. The goal is to ingest these data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools and APIs, then develop a lightweight machine learning classifier to flag drought stress conditions. This report details how to use GCP services (Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, etc.) in combination with geospatial APIs (Google Earth Engine, Google Maps API, and open data APIs) to build an automated data pipeline, estimates the storage requirements and costs, and outlines integration into an ML prototype.

Global 30 m coverage every ~2 weeks, useful for historical comparison and thermal stress (land surface temperature).

**Google Earth Engine:**  _USGS Landsat Collection 2_  (Level-2 Surface Reflectance and Thermal, Tier 1)[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-8#:~:text=Surface%20Reflectance).  
**Cloud Storage Public Bucket:**  `gs://gcp-public-data-landsat`  (Landsat public archive)[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Engine%20team%20has,Google%20Cloud%20public%20data%20program).

**CHIRPS Rainfall (5 km)**

1981–present (daily; use last ~10 years)

Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data – a ~35+ year quasi-global rainfall dataset at ~0.05° (~5.5 km) resolution[chc.ucsb.edu](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps#:~:text=Climate%20Hazards%20Group%20InfraRed%20Precipitation,for%20trend%20analysis%20and%20seasonal). Integrates satellite IR estimates with rain gauges for drought monitoring.

**Google Earth Engine:**  `UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/DAILY`image collection (daily precipitation in mm)[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_DAILY#:~:text=Climate%20Hazards%20Center%20InfraRed%20Precipitation,analysis%20and%20seasonal%20drought%20monitoring).  
**CHC/USGS FTP/API:**  Public domain data files (e.g. via <code>ftp://ftp.chg.ucsb.edu</code>)[chc.ucsb.edu](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps#:~:text=To%20the%20extent%20possible%20under,published%20from%3A%20the%20United%20States).

**SoilGrids (250 m)**

2017 (static global maps)

ISRIC World Soil Information’s SoilGrids v2.0 – global 250 m grids of soil properties (e.g. texture, organic carbon, water capacity) at multiple depths[isric.org](https://www.isric.org/news/soilgrids-data-now-available-google-earth-engine#:~:text=SoilGrids%20provides%20maps%20for%20ten,international%20specification%20of%20GlobalSoilMap%20project). Useful for soil water holding capacity and soil moisture proxy.

**Google Earth Engine:**  ISRIC SoilGrids asset (e.g.  `ISRIC/SoilGrids250m/`…) with layers for various properties/depths[isric.org](https://www.isric.org/news/soilgrids-data-now-available-google-earth-engine#:~:text=SoilGrids%20provides%20maps%20for%20ten,international%20specification%20of%20GlobalSoilMap%20project).  
**ISRIC API:**  REST/OGC services and downloads via soilgrids.org[isric.org](https://www.isric.org/news/soilgrids-data-now-available-google-earth-engine#:~:text=The%20upload%20of%20selected%20SoilGrids,blob%2Fmaster%2Fmarkdown%2Faccess_on_gee.md)[isric.org](https://www.isric.org/news/soilgrids-data-now-available-google-earth-engine#:~:text=The%20SoilGrids%20dataset%20is%20also,see%20here%20for%20more%20information).

**Drone Imagery (Optional)**

On-demand (field-specific)

Very high resolution (cm-level) RGB/NIR imagery from UAV flights over sample fields. Can provide ground truth of crop condition (healthy vs stressed) at small scale.

**Cloud Storage Upload:**  Drone images (e.g. geotiff or orthomosaic) can be uploaded to a GCS bucket for integration.  
**Compute Engine Disk:**  Alternatively, copy data directly onto VM persistent disk if analysis is local.

**Sentinel-2:**  This ESA mission provides 10 m resolution optical imagery with a 5-day revisit (with two satellites) covering all land surfaces[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2#:~:text=Sentinel,vegetation%2C%20soil%2C%20and%20water%20cover). Its Multispectral Instrument has 13 bands spanning visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared, at 10 m, 20 m, and 60 m resolutions[earthdata.nasa.gov](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/sentinel-2-msi#:~:text=Sentinel,bands%20at%2060%20meter%20resolution). These rich spectral bands are ideal for vegetation health indices (e.g. NDVI, EVI) and detecting drought stress in crops. On GCP, Sentinel-2 data is readily available. Google collaborates with ESA to host Sentinel-2 on Cloud Storage as part of the public data program[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Engine%20team%20has,Google%20Cloud%20public%20data%20program). This means you can access Sentinel-2 imagery directly in a GCP project without needing to download from Copernicus hubs. Two convenient access modes are: (a)  **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**  – which provides the entire Sentinel-2 archive as an image collection and allows filtering by date, region, and cloud cover; and (b)  **Cloud Storage Bucket**  –  `gcp-public-data-sentinel-2`, which contains Sentinel-2 tiles as objects. For example, all tiles for a certain area (100 km² grid squares) can be listed and fetched by their path (e.g.  `gs://gcp-public-data-sentinel-2/tiles/33/U/UP/...`)[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/sentinel-2#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20all%20Sentinel,2%2Ftiles%2F33%2FU%2FUP). Using Earth Engine is often easier for preprocessing (e.g. mosaicking, cloud masking) and then exporting data, whereas using the raw Cloud Storage bucket might be useful for bulk download or if using tools like  **STAC**  or  **sentinel-hub**.

**Landsat 8/9:**  Landsat offers a longer historical record at 30 m resolution, with optical and thermal bands. Landsat 8 (since 2013) and Landsat 9 (since 2021) together provide ~8-day revisit coverage[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-8#:~:text=Landsat%2C%20a%20joint%20program%20of,more%20about%20the%20different%20tiers). The data includes a thermal infrared sensor (100 m native, resampled to 30 m) useful for surface temperature – high canopy temperature can indicate water stress. USGS/NASA make Landsat data freely available, and Google hosts Landsat collections on GCP as well[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Engine%20team%20has,Google%20Cloud%20public%20data%20program). Earth Engine’s catalog includes Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 Surface Reflectance imagery, which is analysis-ready (atmospherically corrected)[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-8#:~:text=Surface%20Reflectance). One can query by path/row or by region bounds and date range in Earth Engine. Alternatively, the Cloud Storage public bucket  `gcp-public-data-landsat`(Collection 1) can be accessed with tools like  `gsutil`  or the Cloud Storage API. Each Landsat scene (for NRW, likely 2–3 scenes cover the state) can be 600–800 MB with all bands, so storing selected bands or compressed Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) is advisable.

**CHIRPS Rainfall:**  CHIRPS is a gridded precipitation dataset specifically designed for drought monitoring[chc.ucsb.edu](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps#:~:text=Climate%20Hazards%20Group%20InfraRed%20Precipitation,for%20trend%20analysis%20and%20seasonal). It has ~5 km resolution and is updated daily, combining satellite infrared data with weather station observations. For our use, CHIRPS provides historical rainfall time series to identify precipitation deficits leading to drought stress. Earth Engine includes CHIRPS daily images (in mm/day) from 1981 to near-present[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_DAILY#:~:text=Dataset%20Availability%201981,UCSB%2FCHG)[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_DAILY#:~:text=Climate%20Hazards%20Center%20InfraRed%20Precipitation,analysis%20and%20seasonal%20drought%20monitoring), which can be filtered to the region and date range. The data volume for CHIRPS is relatively small for a single region (a daily grid over NRW would be on the order of only ~1500 pixels). We can decide whether to store full daily rasters or aggregate to monthly sums or anomalies to save space. If not using Earth Engine, CHIRPS data can be downloaded from CHC/UCSB servers (e.g. as NetCDF or TIFF files) – but Earth Engine’s ready availability and slicing by region is very convenient for pipeline automation.

**SoilGrids:**  SoilGrids v2.0 provides static soil property maps at 250 m resolution globally[isric.org](https://www.isric.org/news/soilgrids-data-now-available-google-earth-engine#:~:text=SoilGrids%20provides%20maps%20for%20ten,international%20specification%20of%20GlobalSoilMap%20project). For crop stress, relevant variables might include soil moisture capacity, soil texture, or depth to groundwater. Soil properties are mostly static (don’t change year-to-year), so these can be ingested once. Earth Engine hosts SoilGrids layers (e.g. soil organic carbon, clay percentage, or volumetric water content for various depths) courtesy of ISRIC – this data can be queried for the region[isric.org](https://www.isric.org/news/soilgrids-data-now-available-google-earth-engine#:~:text=The%20upload%20of%20selected%20SoilGrids,blob%2Fmaster%2Fmarkdown%2Faccess_on_gee.md). For example, one can retrieve a soil water holding capacity map or volumetric water content percentile for NRW. The data is on the order of a few hundred MB for a region the size of NRW (since 250 m pixels over 34k km² ~ 540k pixels, and each soil property/depth layer is one band). Storing these as GeoTIFFs in Cloud Storage or as Earth Engine assets is feasible. The  **World Soil**  and agricultural research community (e.g. ISRIC, CGIAR) encourage using these open datasets for agro-environmental analysis[isric.org](https://www.isric.org/news/soilgrids-data-now-available-google-earth-engine#:~:text=Uploading%20SoilsGrids%20data%20to%20Google,the%20platform%20for%20their%20applications).

**Drone Imagery (Optional):**  If high-resolution drone images of specific fields are available (perhaps for a few test sites), they can be uploaded to Cloud Storage and used as a validation dataset. They may serve to visually confirm satellite-detected stress or to generate extra training labels (e.g. mapping stressed vs healthy crop patches). Given their limited extent, the data volume is user-dependent (for instance, a 100 ha farm at 5 cm resolution could be tens of GB). It’s best to keep drone data separate and only pull it in when needed for model training or validation on those specific areas.

## Google Cloud Platform Resources for Data Ingestion

GCP offers a robust infrastructure to manage and process geospatial data at scale. Key services we will use include  **Cloud Storage**,  **Compute Engine**, and  **Google Earth Engine**, among others. Leveraging these in combination allows us to ingest large satellite datasets and build an automated pipeline:

-   **Google Cloud Storage (GCS):**  GCS acts as the data lake for storing raw and processed datasets. We will create a dedicated  **Storage Bucket**  (e.g.  `gs://crop-stress-data`) to hold imagery and other data. Google already hosts public buckets for Sentinel-2 and Landsat, so we can  _directly copy data from those into our bucket or read on-the-fly_, without incurring egress charges (since data is within Google’s network)[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Engine%20team%20has,Google%20Cloud%20public%20data%20program). For example, we can use the  `gsutil`  CLI or GCS API to fetch specific Sentinel-2 tile files from  `gcp-public-data-sentinel-2`and save them in our bucket for NRW. Cloud Storage is designed for durability and scalability, so it can handle large volumes (petabytes) reliably. One can organize the bucket with folders per dataset (`sentinel2/`,  `landsat/`,  `chirps/`,  `soil/`) and further subfolders by date or tile as needed. We will use  **Standard storage class**  for frequently accessed data (e.g. images for model development) and could transition older data to Nearline/Coldline if needed to cut costs. Access control can be managed via IAM (e.g. the Compute Engine service account gets read/write to the bucket).
    
-   **Google Compute Engine (GCE):**  A virtual machine on GCE provides the environment to run data ingestion scripts and ML training code. We will set up a VM (for example, an e2-standard-4 with 4 vCPU and 16 GB RAM for general processing) running a Linux OS. Onto this VM, we can install the Google Cloud SDK (for  `gsutil`  and other tools), the Earth Engine Python API, and any needed Python libraries (geospatial libraries like GDAL, rasterio,  `earthengine-api`, and ML libraries like TensorFlow or scikit-learn). Compute Engine will be used to  **orchestrate the data pipeline**: e.g., a Python script that calls Earth Engine or other APIs to retrieve imagery for a given date and region, and then writes it to Cloud Storage or the VM’s local disk. Because we might run heavy processing (e.g. clipping thousands of satellite scenes to our region), having a configurable VM with enough CPU (or even GPU if doing deep learning) is valuable. Compute Engine also allows scheduling via cron or using  **Cloud Scheduler**  to trigger scripts. Notably, by hosting the processing on GCE within the same cloud as the data, we minimize data transfer time and cost (no downloading to local machines). The Earth Engine FAQ highlights that hosting Landsat/Sentinel on GCP  _“makes it much easier and more efficient to access the data directly from Cloud services such as Google Compute Engine or Cloud ML”_[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Google%20Cloud%20collections%20make,or%20Google%20Cloud%20Machine%20Learning).
    
-   **Google Earth Engine (EE):**  Earth Engine is a geo-analytics platform with a  **petabyte-scale data catalog**  and APIs for processing imagery[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/earth-engine#:~:text=90%2B%20petabytes%20of%20analysis,data). We will use Earth Engine for its strengths in filtering and preprocessing satellite data. For instance, we can use the EE Python API on our GCE VM to: select Sentinel-2 images over NRW for specific dates, apply cloud masks (using the Sentinel-2 QA bands or cloud probability dataset), compute vegetation indices (like NDVI), and then export the results. Earth Engine allows exporting data to Cloud Storage in batch mode: using functions like  `Export.image.toCloudStorage()`  we can send a processed image or stack of images to our GCS bucket as GeoTIFFs[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/export-image-tocloudstorage#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Set%20the%20export%20,image_export%27%2C%20region%3A%20region%2C%20scale%3A%2030)[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/export-image-tocloudstorage#:~:text=region%3A%20region%2C%20scale%3A%2030%2C%20crs%3A,EPSG%3A5070%27%2C%20maxPixels%3A%201e13). For example, we could export a monthly Sentinel-2 NDVI composite image for NRW to  `gs://crop-stress-data/sentinel_ndvi/NDVI_2021_07.tif`. Earth Engine can also be used to extract time-series at points or regions and save as CSV or TFRecord for model input. Keep in mind that Earth Engine requires an account and project setup; it’s free for research/non-profit use[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ISRIC_SoilGrids250m_v2_0#:~:text=Important%3A%20%20Earth%20Engine%20is,register%20for%20Earth%20Engine%20access), but if used in a commercial GCP project you might need to enable the Earth Engine service with appropriate billing. We will register our GCP project for Earth Engine access and use a service account or user OAuth for authentication in the Python API.
    
-   **Google Maps API (optional for visualization):**  While not directly used for data  _ingestion_, the Google Maps API can be useful in this project for visualizing results or obtaining base maps. For instance, after we detect drought stress areas, we might want to overlay those on a map in a web application – Google Maps JavaScript API can be used to display the NRW region with markers/polygons indicating stressed fields. Additionally, Google Maps Elevation or Geocoding API could be tangentially used if we needed elevation data or to convert location names to coordinates (though our bounding box is known, so this is minor). Using Google Maps requires enabling the Maps Platform and API keys, and note that it has its own usage quotas and pricing. In our pipeline, Maps API will mainly come into play at the  **presentation layer**  (if we build a dashboard), rather than in the data collection/storage phase.
    
-   **Other Tools:**  We should mention that if the pipeline grows, GCP has other managed services:  **Cloud Dataflow**(Apache Beam) could handle large-scale parallel downloads or image processing,  **Cloud Functions**  could be used for event-driven tasks (e.g. trigger a function whenever new satellite data is added), and  **Vertex AI**  (formerly AI Platform) can be used to train and deploy ML models at scale. For the proof-of-concept, we’ll stick to Compute Engine and simple scheduling, but these services are available if needed. For example, one could use Vertex AI for managed training of the model on the data exported to Cloud Storage, or use BigQuery GIS if we wanted to do some geospatial queries on tabular features (BigQuery now supports Earth Engine Analytics Hub datasets and even raster analysis via the  `ST_RegionStats`  function[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/earth-engine#:~:text=Earth%20Engine%20in%20BigQuery)). These integrations demonstrate the flexibility of GCP in geospatial workflows.
    

## Automated Data Acquisition Workflow

Automation is crucial for an early warning system – we want the data pipeline to run with minimal manual intervention, updating datasets and generating alerts. Here we outline a step-by-step process to automate data ingestion and storage using the above GCP tools:

1.  **Define Region and Timeframe:**  We’ll define the region of interest (NRW) either by a polygon (e.g. a GeoJSON of the state boundary) or the bounding box coordinates. This will be used to clip or filter datasets. In Earth Engine, for example, one can define  `geometry = ee.Geometry.Rectangle(5.8,50.3, 9.4,52.5)`  for the bounding box, or import a shape of NRW’s administrative boundary for more precision.
    
2.  **VM Setup and Scheduling:**  On our Compute Engine VM, we create a Python script (or notebook) that carries out the data retrieval. We can schedule this script to run at regular intervals (e.g. monthly or during the growing season, depending on how frequently we want to update the model). Options for scheduling include using a cron job on the VM (Linux crontab) or using  **Cloud Scheduler**  to hit a Cloud Function or VM endpoint that starts the job. For simplicity, a cron on the VM (say, the first day of each month at midnight) could call our data update script.
    
3.  **Earth Engine Data Fetching:**  Within the script, we use the Earth Engine API for bulk data extraction:
    
    -   **Sentinel-2:**  We build an Earth Engine image collection query for Sentinel-2 Level-2A (surface reflectance) images over the past period. For example:
        
        python
        
        Copy
        
        `import ee
        ee.Initialize() # Filter Sentinel-2 SR to region, date, low cloud cover s2 = ee.ImageCollection("COPERNICUS/S2_SR")\
               .filterBounds(ee.Geometry.Polygon(nrw_coords))\
               .filterDate('2021-04-01','2021-10-31')\
               .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE', 20))` 
        
        We could then composite or mosaic these images (e.g. take median or maximum NDVI). Suppose we want monthly NDVI median images to see vegetation health each month. We can map over months and compute NDVI = (NIR – Red) / (NIR + Red) for each image, then take median per month. Earth Engine makes this fairly straightforward with its built-in operations. Once we have the image (or image collection) ready, we call  `Export.image.toCloudStorage(...)`  to send it to our Cloud Storage bucket[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/export-image-tocloudstorage#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Set%20the%20export%20,image_export%27%2C%20region%3A%20region%2C%20scale%3A%2030). We specify the bucket name, file name prefix, region (our ROI), scale (10 m), and format (GeoTIFF, possibly Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF if we set  `formatOptions.cloudOptimized: true`[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/export-image-tocloudstorage#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Export%20a%20Cloud%20Optimized,image_export_cog%27%2C%20region%3A%20region%2C%20scale%3A%2030)). This creates an  **Earth Engine export task**. Because large exports are asynchronous, Earth Engine will queue the task. Our script can either poll the task status or simply submit and rely on Earth Engine to complete it. Exports might take some time if the area is large, but Earth Engine handles the heavy lifting on Google’s servers. The output, e.g.  `NDVI_2021_04.tif`, will appear in the Cloud Storage bucket when done.
        
    -   **Landsat & Thermal:**  Similarly, we can use Earth Engine to retrieve Landsat images. For example, to get Land Surface Temperature (LST), we might use Landsat 8 Collection 2, which has a thermal band converted to temperature. Earth Engine’s Landsat SR dataset includes a band for thermal infrared (usually in Kelvin). We can filter by date and region and then export a seasonal composite of LST or perhaps the maximum LST during a dry spell (since unusually high canopy temperature can signal stress). The export process to Cloud Storage is analogous to Sentinel-2.
        
    -   **CHIRPS:**  For rainfall, we have a couple of strategies. Because CHIRPS is low resolution, instead of storing daily raster files (which are small for the region but numerous in count), we might aggregate into features. For example, compute the 30-day precipitation total or the anomaly compared to the 30-year average. Earth Engine can compute per-pixel sums or differences over time using the CHIRPS ImageCollection[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_DAILY#:~:text=Climate%20Hazards%20Center%20InfraRed%20Precipitation,analysis%20and%20seasonal%20drought%20monitoring). We could generate a monthly rainfall anomaly image and export that. Alternatively, since we might integrate rainfall as a numeric feature in our ML model, we could extract the time series to a table. For instance, sample the CHIRPS collection at points or zones (like averaging over the state or over agricultural districts) and export CSV files. Earth Engine’s  `Export.table.toCloudStorage`or  `.toDrive`  could be used if we go that route. But an easier approach: the script can use the Earth Engine API to get a dictionary of precipitation values for each date (since the data volume is tiny) and then save it directly from Python. For example, using  `ee.ImageCollection.reduceRegion()`  for total rainfall in ROI.
        
    -   **SoilGrids:**  Since SoilGrids is static, we may not need to automate its retrieval regularly. We can do a one-time fetch. For example, use Earth Engine to get the soil property images (like available water capacity or soil organic carbon) for the region and export them as GeoTIFFs to Cloud Storage. If we prefer not to export through Earth Engine (to save our quota), an alternative is using the SoilGrids REST API to download the data. SoilGrids allows querying by bounding box and property. But given Earth Engine has it readily, a one-time EE export is simplest. These files will then reside in our bucket (e.g.  `soil/soil_AWC.tif`).
        
4.  **Using Cloud Storage and Compute Engine Together:**  When Earth Engine exports images to Cloud Storage, our Compute Engine VM can access them either by the GCS API (e.g. using the Python Google Cloud Storage client) or by mounting the bucket. A convenient method during development is to use  `gsutil`  to copy data locally: e.g.  `gsutil cp gs://crop-stress-data/sentinel_ndvi/NDVI_2021_04.tif /home/user/data/`. However, for large data it might be better to read directly from GCS without copying to disk, using libraries that can handle cloud URLs (e.g.  `rasterio`  can read  `gs://`  paths with the proper configuration, or using  `gcsfs`). For automation, our script can wait for Earth Engine tasks to finish (checking task status via the API) before proceeding to the next step. In cases where Earth Engine isn’t used (suppose we directly wanted to use the public buckets), the script would instead list the required objects. For example, to get all Sentinel-2 L2A images for 2021 over NRW, we could use the index or naming convention to find relevant tiles (this is more complex, which is why we favor Earth Engine for filtering by region). Google provides an index CSV for the Sentinel-2 bucket (`gs://gcp-public-data-sentinel-2/index.csv.gz`) which one could query to find scene IDs that intersect our area[gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/352876/downloading-sentinel-2-l2a-with-google-cloud-bigquery#:~:text=sentinel)  – but using Earth Engine’s spatial filter is far simpler.
    
5.  **Data Cleaning and Organization:**  Once the data is in Cloud Storage or on the VM, we organize it. For raster images exported, ensure they have consistent projection and alignment (Earth Engine exports typically in WGS84 / EPSG:4326 or UTM – we might choose UTM Zone 32U for NRW, for instance). We might store raw images and also derived products. For example, we might store the raw NDVI images and also compute zonal statistics per district if needed. Automation includes any preprocessing like converting data formats or stacking bands. If the ML model expects a combined feature stack (e.g. NDVI + rainfall + soil moisture), we might create a multi-band raster or a tabular feature file at this stage. Python code can use libraries like NumPy or Pandas to merge data. For instance, take the NDVI and precipitation anomaly image and create a 2-band GeoTIFF or sample a set of points to create a table of [NDVI, precip, soil] features with a label (if we have ground truth of stress vs no stress).
    
6.  **Repeat and Update:**  The pipeline can run periodically to fetch new data. During the growing season, we might run it more frequently (e.g. weekly Sentinel-2 NDVI updates). Because it’s automated, new images would be added to our Cloud Storage bucket. We could implement retention policies or archival: e.g. keep only the last N years of data in “hot” storage and move older imagery to cold storage if needed. If using Earth Engine continuously, note there are daily quotas on data export, so large-scale exports (hundreds of GB) might need to be spread over time or requested via batch processing.
    

By automating with these steps, the pipeline will populate our storage with up-to-date satellite indices, rainfall metrics, and static layers – all the inputs needed for the ML model to analyze crop stress.

## Storage Requirements and Sizing

One important aspect is estimating how much storage is needed for the collected data, so we can provision adequate disk space or Cloud Storage capacity. Table 2 provides an estimate of data volumes for the chosen region (NRW) and a ~10-year time horizon, for each dataset:

**Table 2 – Approximate Data Volume Estimates (NRW, 10-year period)**

Dataset

Spatial Resolution / Coverage

Temporal Frequency (10-year span)

Estimated Volume (for NRW)

**Sentinel-2 L2A**  (ESA)

10 m pixels (~100 km² tiles)

~5-day revisit ⇒ ~73 images/year per tile. NRW spans ~4–5 Sentinel-2 tiles; ~730 images/year total.

**~1.0–1.5 TB**  of imagery (for 10 years). Each Sentinel-2 scene (all bands) is ~500–800 MB; ~3000 scenes over 10 years[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Engine%20team%20has,Google%20Cloud%20public%20data%20program). If storing only indices or cropped areas, volume can be less.

**Landsat 8/9**(USGS/NASA)

30 m pixels (185 km swath scenes)

16-day revisit per satellite (~23 scenes/year per path). ~2 path/rows cover NRW; ~40–50 scenes/year.

**~0.3–0.5 TB**  for 10 years. Each Landsat scene ~600 MB. Using only selected bands (e.g. thermal, NIR, red) or compressed files can reduce size.

**CHIRPS Rainfall**

0.05° (~5 km) grid, NRW ~50x70 pixels

Daily images (3650 days/10yr). Often aggregated to monthly (120 months/10yr).

**~<1 GB**  for 10 years of NRW subset. Each daily NRW subset is ~<100 KB (few thousand values). Storing as CSV or NetCDF for time-series is very lightweight.

**SoilGrids**(v2.0)

250 m grid, ~540k pixels in NRW

Static (one-time) for each property/depth. ~10 properties × 6 depths = 60 layers possible (if all used).

**~200–500 MB**  for NRW. Each layer ~2–8 MB when clipped. All properties combined <0.5 GB. (Global SoilGrids dataset is large, but we subset to region.)

**Drone Imagery**

~5 cm (very high-res), cover small fields

Occasional captures (not continuous)

Varies (user-provided). E.g., one 100 ha field at 5cm resolution can be ~10–20 GB orthomosaic. Only a few of these would be included for case studies, so total <100 GB typically.

_Assumptions:_  The Sentinel-2 estimate assumes we store a significant fraction of images (e.g. all cloud-filtered images). In practice, we might not need every scene – we could store seasonal composites or only the worst-case drought period images to cut down size. Similarly, Landsat data could be sampled (e.g. one image per month). CHIRPS is so small for our region that it’s negligible in size.

**Disk vs Cloud Storage:**  We have the option to store data on a persistent disk attached to the VM or in Cloud Storage. Given the volumes above, using Cloud Storage is advantageous for large datasets (Sentinel, Landsat) because it separates storage from compute and is easier to scale. If we used a VM’s disk alone, we’d need a disk of ~2 TB to hold everything, which is possible (GCE allows large persistent disks) but can be costly and less flexible. Instead, we can keep most data in Cloud Storage buckets and only pull what’s needed to the VM when processing. We could maintain a local cache on an attached SSD for fast access to recent images if needed. Cloud Storage standard class costs around  **$0.02–$0.023 per GB per month**  in European regions[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#:~:text=Warsaw%20%28%60europe,0003), so 1 TB costs on the order of $20–$23/month in storage fees. If our total data ends up ~2 TB, that’s ~$40–50 per month for storage. This is a rough recurring cost to budget for. An alternative is compressing or downsampling data: e.g., storing NDVI mosaics (which are smaller) instead of full spectral images can cut storage by >80%. We can also choose archival storage for older years if we won’t access them often (Coldline storage is ~$0.004/GB/month[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#:~:text=Iowa%20%28%60us,0003), much cheaper, though with access/read fees). For the prototype, standard storage is fine, but it’s good to be aware of these options.

It’s also worth noting that Google’s hosting of Sentinel/Landsat in the  **public datasets program**  means that accessing those data  _in cloud_  does not incur egress charges – we only pay for storage if we copy them to our own bucket and for the compute to process. Google covers the egress and hosting of the raw data[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets#:~:text=Cloud%20Storage%20provides%20a%20variety,console%20and%20Google%20Cloud%20CLI)[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Engine%20team%20has,Google%20Cloud%20public%20data%20program). This is a big advantage of doing the project on GCP: we can leverage the free availability of base imagery and only pay for what we store or compute with.

## Cost Considerations

When deploying this pipeline, it’s important to consider various cost factors on GCP: storage, compute, and external API usage. Here we outline the key cost considerations and how to manage them:

-   **Cloud Storage Costs:**  As estimated, storing multi-terabyte satellite data will incur monthly costs. For example, ~1 TB of Sentinel-2 data might cost around $23/month in a europe-west region[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#:~:text=Warsaw%20%28%60europe,0003). Our entire dataset (maybe ~2 TB including all imagery) might be ~$40–$50/month. To optimize costs:
    
    -   Store only necessary data. Instead of full-resolution raw imagery for every date, we store derived products (indices, composites) that are smaller.
        
    -   Use efficient file formats (COGs, compressed TIFFs, NetCDF for time series) to reduce size.
        
    -   Apply lifecycle policies on the bucket: e.g. data older than 1 year transitions to Nearline or Coldline storage which is cheaper (nearline ~$0.01/GB-month)[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#:~:text=Iowa%20%28%60us,0003). Since historical data might be accessed infrequently (the model might focus on the current growing season), this can save money.
        
    -   Remember that data  _ingress_  is free, and egress (downloading out of GCP) costs money. If you plan to download results to a local machine or share data outside GCP, account for egress fees (~$0.12 per GB from Europe to internet). Keeping all processing within GCP avoids egress fees.
        
-   **Compute Engine Costs:**  Running the VM incurs hourly charges. For example, an e2-standard-4 in europe-west1 is on the order of ~$0.10 per hour. If you run it 24/7, that’s ~$72/month. However, we likely do not need it running constantly. We can start it when performing heavy processing and shut it down when idle. For scheduled tasks, one strategy is to use a  **startup script**  or a  **Cloud Scheduler-triggered Cloud Function**  to start the VM at a certain time, have it run the pipeline, then stop the VM. This way, we pay only for the hours used. Another approach is using  **preemptible VM instances**  which are ~70-80% cheaper, if the task can tolerate interruption or can be run in chunks. In a prototype stage, we might simply run the VM manually when needed, or keep it on during critical periods.  
    Additionally, if we choose to use  **Vertex AI**  for training the model, that would have its own cost (similar charges for the compute resources used during training). But for a lightweight model (e.g. a small sklearn random forest), a standard CPU VM is sufficient.
    
-   **Earth Engine and API usage:**  Google Earth Engine itself is free for research purposes (with quotas)[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ISRIC_SoilGrids250m_v2_0#:~:text=Important%3A%20%20Earth%20Engine%20is,register%20for%20Earth%20Engine%20access). There is currently no charge for Earth Engine processing or data access under the non-commercial agreement, which is extremely cost-effective given it can leverage Google’s servers for heavy geospatial computations. If this project were to move to a commercial deployment, Earth Engine would require a paid license or use of Google Cloud’s commercial integration (Earth Engine can now be enabled in Google Cloud projects for commercial use with a pricing model). But for our proof-of-concept, we can assume zero cost for Earth Engine usage aside from the necessity of having a GCP project for authentication. The main limitation is the quotas (e.g. daily export limit, computational limits), which we should stay within or request increases for if needed.
    
-   **Google Maps API costs:**  If we incorporate Google Maps for visualization (for example, an interactive map showing drought stress alerts), the Maps API has a freemium model. Currently, Google offers $200 free credit per month for Maps API usage. A typical map load costs a few fractions of a cent. Unless our tool has heavy traffic, it’s likely the free credit covers it. If not, the cost might be a few dollars per thousand map loads. This is relatively minor compared to the data and compute costs, but it’s good to monitor usage with the Google Maps Platform quota dashboard.
    
-   **Third-party API costs:**  CHIRPS, SoilGrids, and other open datasets are free to use. CHIRPS data is public domain[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_DAILY#:~:text=Terms%20of%20Use), SoilGrids is under open license[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ISRIC_SoilGrids250m_v2_0#:~:text=Terms%20of%20Use). So there are no direct costs for these data. The only consideration is if we were to use a lot of bandwidth downloading from external sources (e.g. if not using Earth Engine for CHIRPS but hitting the UCSB server daily for large regions, which could strain bandwidth). But since our approach uses Earth Engine and GCP’s internal data, we avoid those concerns.
    
-   **Scaling considerations:**  If the project scales up (e.g. to all of Germany or multiple countries, or higher temporal frequency, or more complex models), costs will scale too. More data storage and more compute hours would be needed. In that scenario, one might consider more advanced cost-optimization strategies: e.g. using BigQuery to store long time-series of indices in a compact form (BigQuery has pricing per TB of data processed in queries), or using Cloud Dataflow to stream process daily images without storing everything. For now, our focus is on feasibility, so a modest budget should suffice: perhaps a few hundred USD per month covering storage and occasional compute.
    

To summarize, the prototype pipeline is relatively economical given the free availability of base imagery on GCP[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Engine%20team%20has,Google%20Cloud%20public%20data%20program)  and Earth Engine’s no-cost processing for research. The main costs – Cloud Storage (~$40+/mo for TBs of data) and Compute Engine (tens of $/mo if running intermittently) – can be managed and are justifiable for a project demonstrating high-value outcomes like early drought stress warnings.

## Prototype Model Integration and AI Workflow

With the data collected and organized, the next step is to integrate it into a machine learning workflow to detect or predict crop drought stress. The guiding principle here is  **keeping the model lightweight and interpretable**, using minimal but informative inputs (satellite indices, weather, soil). Below, we outline how to build and integrate a prototype ML model:

-   **Feature Engineering:**  Based on the ingested data, we will derive features that indicate stress. Likely features include:
    
    -   **Vegetation Index Anomaly:**  Using Sentinel-2 NDVI (or EVI) time series, we can calculate how current vegetation greenness deviates from the norm. For example, for each pixel or region, compute NDVI for the current period and compare to the average NDVI of that location for the same time in non-drought years. A significantly lower NDVI suggests vegetation stress. This anomaly can be a primary feature.
        
    -   **Thermal/Surface Temperature:**  If using Landsat thermal data or a temperature product (like MODIS LST could be another option), a higher land surface temperature in a field compared to normal can signal drought stress (due to reduced evaporative cooling). We can include features like average daytime LST anomaly.
        
    -   **Soil Moisture/Soil Water Capacity:**  Direct soil moisture data at high resolution is not easily available without specialized sensors, but static soil properties from SoilGrids can act as proxies. For instance, soil available water capacity (AWC) will influence how quickly a crop experiences stress during a dry spell. We might use the SoilGrids-derived AWC or clay content as a feature, though it won’t change temporally – it helps stratify areas by inherent drought susceptibility.
        
    -   **Rainfall Deficit:**  From CHIRPS, we can compute the precipitation over the last X days or the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for a 1-month or 3-month period. This essentially quantifies meteorological drought. If rainfall in the last month is in, say, the lowest 10th percentile historically, that’s a strong indicator of drought conditions. Including SPI or rainfall percentile as a feature will help the model distinguish areas that are dry vs areas that had normal rain (where poor NDVI might be due to other factors).
        
    -   **Optional additional features:**  If available, one could integrate things like irrigation data (any known irrigated vs rainfed field info), or use MODIS evapotranspiration or soil moisture satellite data (e.g. SMAP at coarse resolution) to enrich the feature set. However, to keep it lightweight, we focus on the core three: vegetation index, rainfall, soil.
        
-   **Training Data and Labels:**  A supervised classifier needs labeled examples of “drought stress” vs “no stress”. Creating these labels can be challenging without ground truth, but for a proof of concept we can utilize known drought events. For example, identify time periods and locations in NRW that were affected by drought (say, summer 2018 was a severe drought in Europe). Those could be labeled as “stressed” for crops, whereas a year with normal rainfall and healthy crops (say, 2016) could be “not stressed”. If agricultural yield statistics or farmer reports exist, they could be used to label regions/years of crop failure due to drought. In absence of extensive ground truth, one approach is to use unsupervised detection of anomalies: e.g., cluster or threshold NDVI and rainfall anomalies to flag likely stressed areas (and treat those as positive labels). Another approach is to use Earth Engine’s built-in classifiers on known impacted vs unaffected areas, if any data is available – Earth Engine supports CART, Random Forest, SVM for land classification tasks[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/machine-learning#:~:text=,attempts%20to%20bucket%20each%20input). For simplicity, we might derive labels from thresholds: e.g., define a pixel as stressed if NDVI is more than 1 standard deviation below normal and 2-month rainfall is <50% of normal. Those criteria can generate a binary label map that we use to train a classifier.
    
-   **Model Choice:**  We aim for a  _lightweight ML model_. This could be a decision tree or random forest, which are fast to train and easy to interpret (they can handle non-linear relationships and feature importance is accessible). A logistic regression could also be used if we want a simple probability of drought stress. Given the data volume (if per-pixel, potentially millions of points), we might sample a subset for training or aggregate by zones (e.g. average features per municipality or 1 km grid cell to reduce sample count). A random forest from scikit-learn on a few thousand samples will train in seconds. If we were to explore deep learning, we could use TensorFlow to create a small neural network, but that’s likely overkill for this POC. Moreover, as Google’s Earth Engine docs note, deep learning models should be trained outside Earth Engine using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/machine-learning#:~:text=Deep%20learning%20and%20neural%20networks,model%20outside%20of%20Earth%20Engine)  – in our pipeline, that means using our Compute Engine VM or Vertex AI. Since our focus is not heavy imagery classification but rather combining a few indicators, classical ML is sufficient.
    
-   **Integration with GCP ML Tools:**  We have two paths: train locally on the VM or use a managed service. For agility, we can prototype with a Jupyter notebook on the VM (or use  **AI Platform Notebooks**  which is a managed JupyterLab environment on GCP). We load the features (from Cloud Storage or local CSVs) into memory and fit the model. During development, we’ll evaluate the model’s accuracy and adjust features or thresholds. If we wanted to take it further, we could use  **Vertex AI AutoML**  for tabular data to see if an automated approach yields a good model – Vertex AutoML Tables can take our dataset (e.g. each data point is a region-month with features and a drought/not-drought label) and try various algorithms. There is a cost for AutoML, but it might not be necessary for the prototype.
    
-   **Model Deployment and Inference:**  Once a model is trained (say we finalize a Random Forest that looks at NDVI anomaly, SPI, and soil type), how do we apply it continuously? For an early warning tool, we would run inference on new data as it comes in (e.g. each time we add a new monthly image). This can be done on the same VM: load the latest features and apply the model to each pixel or each region polygon. The output could be a map of “drought stress risk” (binary or a probability). We can then write this result back to Cloud Storage or even directly to an Earth Engine asset for easy mapping. In fact, Earth Engine now allows hosting your own model and doing inference in Earth Engine’s environment via  `ee.Model.fromVertexAi`  if you deployed the model to Vertex AI prediction endpoints[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/machine-learning#:~:text=,cloud%20service%20like%20Cloud%20Functions). That means we could theoretically host the model on Vertex and have Earth Engine apply it to every pixel seamlessly, producing a drought alert map. This is a cutting-edge integration where Earth Engine can call a Vertex AI model on the fly. However, for a lightweight prototype, we might simply output the predictions as a GeoTIFF or shapefile of alert areas.
    
-   **Visualization and Alerting:**  The final piece could be to visualize or notify stakeholders. We might create a simple web map (using a Flask app or Google Maps API front-end) that highlights areas flagged by the model. Cloud Storage can host the results (e.g. a JSON or GeoJSON of affected areas) which the front-end fetches. Alternatively, we can push results into a BigQuery table or a Google Sheets and use Data Studio or a dashboard to show alerts. If automated alerts are needed, one could set up a Cloud Function to trigger when a new results file is saved, which then sends an email or message if the stress level exceeds a threshold. These are optional extensions to demonstrate the  _feasibility_  and usefulness of the pipeline.
    

To give an example outcome: Suppose in July 2025 the rainfall in parts of NRW was 30% of normal and the NDVI dropped significantly. The pipeline would ingest June–July data, the model would identify those patterns, and flag those areas. We’d get an output (map or list of coordinates) for “Potential Drought Stress Detected”. This could then be compared with ground observations if available. The entire process from data ingestion to model output can be made to run in an automated fashion, providing near-real-time early warnings.

## Conclusion

In this technical guide, we demonstrated how to leverage Google Cloud Platform and geospatial APIs to build an end-to-end pipeline for crop drought stress detection. We covered the data sources (Sentinel-2, Landsat, CHIRPS, SoilGrids, etc.) and how they can be accessed through GCP’s Earth Engine and public datasets[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Engine%20team%20has,Google%20Cloud%20public%20data%20program)[chc.ucsb.edu](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps#:~:text=Climate%20Hazards%20Group%20InfraRed%20Precipitation,for%20trend%20analysis%20and%20seasonal). We outlined using Cloud Storage as a central repository for imagery and Compute Engine as the processing workhorse, with Earth Engine simplifying the ingestion and preprocessing of large satellite data. The pipeline can be automated to routinely fetch and update the data, and we estimated the storage needs (~1–2 TB) and associated costs (on the order of tens of dollars per month for storage, plus compute time) with suggestions to optimize resource usage. Finally, we integrated these components into a lightweight machine learning prototype – focusing on key indicators like vegetation index and rainfall anomalies – to flag potential drought stress in crops.

This approach highlights the  **feasibility**  of an AI-driven early warning system built with minimal inputs and cloud-based tools. By utilizing official open datasets (from ESA, NASA/USGS, UCSB Climate Hazards Center, ISRIC) and GCP’s scalable infrastructure, even a small team can develop a prototype that processes years of remote sensing data and delivers actionable insights[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-8#:~:text=Landsat%2C%20a%20joint%20program%20of,more%20about%20the%20different%20tiers)[isric.org](https://www.isric.org/news/soilgrids-data-now-available-google-earth-engine#:~:text=SoilGrids%20provides%20maps%20for%20ten,international%20specification%20of%20GlobalSoilMap%20project). As next steps, one could refine the model with more training data (collaborating with agricultural institutions for ground truth), incorporate additional variables (e.g. evapotranspiration or crop models), and develop a user-friendly interface for farmers or policymakers. The modular nature of the pipeline means it can be extended to other regions or scales – for instance, scaling up from one German state to entire countries by simply adjusting the region of interest and ensuring sufficient compute resources.

In summary, GCP provides an effective platform to ingest, store, and analyze multi-modal environmental data for agriculture. The combination of Earth Engine’s geospatial catalog and processing[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/earth-engine#:~:text=90%2B%20petabytes%20of%20analysis,data)  with Cloud Storage and Compute for custom workflows strikes a balance between ease-of-use and flexibility. With prudent data management and efficient ML modeling, the pipeline achieves a powerful outcome: the ability to detect early signs of drought stress, helping to mitigate crop losses through timely warnings and interventions.
